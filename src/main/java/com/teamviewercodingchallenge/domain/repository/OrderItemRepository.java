 * File: OrderItemRepository.java
 * Description: This file defines the repository interface for managing OrderItem entities.
 * Author: Alexander D Spies
 * Date: 9 March 2024
 * 
 * This repository interface extends JpaRepository, providing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations
 * for OrderItem entities in the database.
 * 
 * Dependencies:
 * - Spring Data JPA: Provides JpaRepository interface for working with JPA entities.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - This interface is used to define methods for accessing and manipulating OrderItem entities in the database.
 * - Extending JpaRepository allows this repository to inherit methods for CRUD operations without needing to implement them.
 * - Customize the repository interface according to the specific data access requirements of your application.
 * 
 * For more information about Spring Data JPA, refer to the official documentation:
 * - Spring Data JPA: https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa

// Import statements for classes and interfaces this repository depends on. These enable the use of JPA (Java Persistence API) functionalities and integration with Spring Data JPA.
import com.teamviewercodingchallenge.domain.model.OrderItem; // Imports the OrderItem entity class. Note: Java package names are case-sensitive; ensure consistency in naming.
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository; // Imports the JpaRepository interface from Spring Data JPA, providing CRUD operations for entities.

// Declares the OrderItemRepository interface extending JpaRepository. This enables it to inherit methods for working with OrderItem data in the database.
public interface OrderItemRepository extends JpaRepository<OrderItem, Long> {
    // By extending JpaRepository, OrderItemRepository inherits methods to save, delete, and find OrderItem entities, among others.
    // The first type parameter, OrderItem, specifies the entity type the repository manages.
    // The second type parameter, Long, specifies the type of the entity's primary key.
